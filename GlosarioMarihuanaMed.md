Un bong consiste esencialmente en un recipiente con aire y agua, al que se incorpora un tubo conductor de humo. Al fumar, dicho tubo guía el aire hacia abajo, por debajo del nivel de agua, donde burbujea hacia arriba durante la aspiración.

ESPANOL
https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoide


[Cannabinoids](http://www.leafly.com/knowledge-center/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine) are the chemical compounds unique to cannabis that act upon the human body’s cannabinoid receptors, producing various effects including [pain relief](http://www.leafly.com/explore/symptoms-pain) and other medically beneficial uses. Marijuana’s most well-known cannabanoid is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) due to the fact that it is the most abundant, and also because it produces the psychoactive effects (or the “high”) that drives the plant’s recreational use. However, there are over 85 known cannabinoids all with varying effects, so THC isn’t the only one.

#### THC

El [tetrahidrocannabinol (THC)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahidrocannabinol) es unos de los cannabinoides mas disponibles en cannabis. El THC es el elemento responsable por los efectos psicoactivos en el cannabis. Se han hecho estudios y el THC es un suplemento efectivo para muchas condiciones de salud. No hay dosis letal de THC.


THC is an abbreviation for tetrahydrocannabinol. It is the most well-known and most abundantly available [cannabinoid](http://www.leafly.com/knowledge-center/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine) in marijuana plants. THC is also the component in marijuana that is responsible for the psychoactive effects, or the “high.” Research has shown THC to be an effective medical treatment for a range of conditions. There is no lethal dose of the compound in its natural form.

#### CBD

CBD es la abreviación de [cannabidiol](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol), y es una de 85 cannabinoides en canabis.

CBD is the abbreviation for cannabidiol, one of the at least 85 [cannabinoids](http://www.leafly.com/knowledge-center/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine) found in cannabis. Recently, [CBD](http://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/whats-the-deal-with-these-high-cbd-strains) has gained support for its use as a medical treatment as research has shown it effectively treats [pain](http://www.leafly.com/explore/symptoms-pain), [inflammation](http://www.leafly.com/explore/symptoms-inflammation), and [anxiety](http://www.leafly.com/explore/conditions-anxiety) without the psychoactive effects (the “high” or “stoned” feeling) associated with THC. High CBD strains, such as [Harlequin](http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin), are being bred more actively and appearing more frequently on the market.



## Concentrates

[Concentrates](http://www.leafly.com/knowledge-center/cannabis-101/the-great-wide-world-of-cannabis-concentrates) are a potent consolidation of [cannabinoids](http://www.leafly.com/knowledge-center/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine) that are made by dissolving marijuana in its plant form into a solvent. It is recommended vaporize concentrates between 300℃ and 400℃. If you're unfamiliar to vaporizing concentrates with a torch, it is recommended to use the torch to warm banger for 30 seconds and leaving it to cool for 30 seconds before inserting, or often reffered to dabbing, the concentrate into the hot banger.

A strain is a specific variety of a plant species. Strains are developed to produce distinct desired traits in the plant and are usually named by their breeders (or by creative consumers). Strain names often reflect the plant’s appearance, its promised buzz, or its place of origin. Although the medical marijuana industry strives for consistency, strains can easily be mistakenly or purposely misidentified.

#### Indica

[Indica](http://www.leafly.com/indica) is the less scientific name for the _Cannabis indica_ species of cannabis. Compared to their sativa counterparts, the plants are shorter, bushier and have more compact flower structure. This species tends to produce more relaxing physical effects and can have a sedative quality. An easy method to remember Indica strains is the couch potato effect, you often hear the "In da Couch" references. Indica = "In Da Couch"
